# Big Data Project: US Accident Database Management 🚗💥

This project focuses on managing massive databases related to US accident data using various Big Data technologies, including **Hadoop**, **Hive**, **MongoDB**, **Nifi**, and **Tableau**. The goal is to demonstrate how Big Data tools can be used for effective data storage, processing, and visualization.

## Project Overview 📝

The project includes several key components:

- **Article & Report**:  
  I have published an article and a comprehensive report that describe the methodology, tools, and outcomes of the project. These documents offer in-depth insights into the management and analysis of the accident data using Big Data technologies.

- **Demo Videos**:  
  Watch the demo videos where I walk you through the system architecture, usage of the tools, and how data is processed and visualized.

- **Website**:

- **Guides (PDF)**:  
  I have included guides in PDF format to help you navigate through the project’s setup, the integration of Big Data tools, and best practices.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **Hadoop Network**:  
  For distributed data processing.

- **Hive**:  
  For querying large datasets in a distributed manner.

- **MongoDB**:  
  NoSQL database used for storing accident data.

- **Nifi**:  
  For automating the movement of data between different systems.

- **Tableau**:  
  For visualizing the processed data and presenting the results.
